## Kali-Init


### About The Project
Kali-Init contains Ansible Roles to install additional frameworks and packages for a Kali Linux installation.


## Ansible Roles
#### C2-Frameworks
The ```C2-Frameworks``` role contains the c2 frameworks outlined in the [c2-matrix](https://howto.thec2matrix.com).
Note, this role just clones the repos but does not do any additional configuration for deployment. Seek stand-alone
roles for specific configuration.

#### RE-Frameworks
The ```RE-Frameworks``` role automates the downloading and installing of Ghidra and IDA Pro Free.
